Title: A simple interface to scraping data from the Department of Water Resources
Description: This provides a simple, but relatively general function for reading data from  tables 
  on Web pages served by the California Data Exchange Center.
  This was originally written as an example of how to scrape the data from 4 different pages but is 
  slightly more general now.
